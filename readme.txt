I did not know how strict I should follow the task in terms of interface of PointOfSaleTerminal, so I decided to provide two variants

1 variant. I'm strictly following interface provided in the task
2 variant. Provided interface is just a concept and I can read it loosly

Assumptions
- Product Quantity might be only of integer type
- Only one or zero volume discount rules can be applicable to a product
- All provided product codes exist in products DB
- Product Codes are always in uppercase
